## Introduction

Building a native-feel financial calculator app—with offline capability, real-time interactivity, and a polished UI—can be deceptively complex. As developers, we lean on AI-assisted tools to accelerate scaffolding, enforce best practices, and minimize tedious iteration. Recently, I benchmarked two leading AI-powered assistants—Bolt and Cursor—against a shared objective: deliver an Android-only Expo SDK 53 app featuring both an EMI calculator and a Goal Planner. Here’s how the two tools stacked up.

## Experiment Setup

### **Bolt Prompt**  
A concise, single-sentence request:

1. > Build me a native React Native Android app for EMI calculation with real-time sliders, synchronized text inputs, and export-ready structure.
    

### **Cursor Prompt**  
A detailed brief mirroring every build requirement:

1. * Calculator types, real-time feedback, pie chart output, form validation, Expo SDK 53 compatibility, type-safe components.

## Bolt’s Experience: One Clean Shot

* **Folder Structure**: Immediately generated logical `components/`, `screens/`, and `utils/` folders.
    
* **SDK Compatibility**: Brought in the correct Expo 53 dependencies out of the box.
    
* **Interactive Preview**: Loaded instantly in Expo Go—no manual tweaks.
    
* **UI Synchronization**: Sliders and inputs stayed in lockstep, with polished styling baked in.
    
* **Test Suite**: Delivered Jest tests for `calcEMI()`, `calcMonthlySIP()`, and `calcLumpSum()` right alongside the functions.
    
* **Deployment**: Project was EAS-build-ready without additional configuration.

## Cursor’s Struggle: Fifty Iterations Later

Despite the detailed prompt, Cursor’s output required substantial manual intervention:

* **Broken Structure**: Components scattered, imports misaligned.
    
* **Version Mismatch**: Incorrect React/Expo combo leading to runtime errors.
    
* **UI Glitches**: Sliders often failed to update fields; layout margins inconsistent.
    
* **No Preview**: Expo Go would error out until dependency versions were fixed by hand.
    
* **Testing Omitted**: No unit tests generated; calculation logic had to be extracted and wrapped manually.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| **Feature** | **Bolt** (✅) | **Cursor** (❌) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folder Structure | Clean and logical | Disjointed |
| Expo SDK 53 Compatibility | Spot on | Version chaos |
| React Integration | Seamless | Compatibility errors |
| Live UI Preview | Immediate | Nonexistent |
| Slider–Input Synchronization | Butter-smooth | Buggy and laggy |
| Required Iterations | 1 | 50+ |
| Production-Ready Output | Yes | No |
| Built-In Test Suite | Included | Absent |

## Why Bolt Resonates with Vibe Coders

For those of us who pride ourselves on crafting “vibes” rather than just code, Bolt delivers:

* **Speed**: One prompt, one project.
    
* **Reliability**: Adheres to specified SDK and architecture.
    
* **Polish**: Out-of-the-box UI consistency and instant previews.
    
* **Cleanliness**: Well-structured code and automatic tests.
    

Cursor’s powerful agent layer shows promise, but until it masters spec fidelity and dependency alignment, it can’t match Bolt for truly native mobile builds.

## Conclusion

In real-world app development, time saved on setup and iteration directly translates to better focus on UX nuances, edge-case handling, and performance tuning. Bolt’s single-shot success on this financial calculator—complete with unit tests and APK readiness—makes it a clear winner for developers who demand both speed and quality.

**If you’ve tried Bolt or Cursor in your own projects, I’d love to hear your experiences and war stories in the comments. Let’s keep elevating our coder vibes together.**
